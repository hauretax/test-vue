# Edumaper

## index page
This is the homepage. It allows the student to enter various types of information, such as grades obtained during the school year, final exam results (baccalauréat), current school, major, and chosen options.

## Application Page


This page is designed to track the places where the student has currently applied, along with feedback on the probability of being accepted at each of them.

### Header

### InfoScolarForm
